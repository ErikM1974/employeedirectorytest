feat: add support for multiple artwork images

- Update image endpoint to handle File_Upload_One through Four
- Modify artwork cards to display up to 4 images in a 2x2 grid
- Add CSS styling for multiple image layout
- Improve image container styling and file path display
- Better error handling for missing images

This change allows artwork cards to show all available images
instead of just File_Upload_One, providing a better overview
of the artwork files.
