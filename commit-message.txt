feat: add image viewer for artwork files

- Add ImageViewer component for full-size image display
- Add click handlers to open images in viewer
- Support all four image upload fields (One through Four)
- Add modal overlay with image info and close button
- Improve image display with hover effects

This change allows users to click on any artwork image to view
it in a larger modal window, making it easier to examine the
artwork files in detail.
