refactor: update artwork search to use User_Email field

- Change CustomerServiceRep field to User_Email for consistency with Caspio table
- Update frontend search form with email input type and validation
- Update backend search and sort functionality to use User_Email
- Add test cases to verify email search functionality
- Fix sorting options to use correct field names
- Improve search accuracy with exact email matching

This change ensures the search functionality correctly uses the User_Email field
from the Caspio table instead of CustomerServiceRep, making the search more
accurate and consistent with the database structure.
