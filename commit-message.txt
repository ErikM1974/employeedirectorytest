feat: improve artwork image endpoint error handling

- Add check for artwork existence before fetching image
- Add check for File_Upload_One field
- Return appropriate 404 status codes with descriptive messages
- Better error handling for missing images vs server errors
- Add test script for image endpoint functionality

This improves the user experience by providing clear feedback when
images are not available or artwork doesn't exist.
