feat: improve artwork image display

- Add proper file extension handling for images (png, jpg, etc.)
- Display filename and extension in overlay
- Implement 2x2 grid layout for multiple images
- Add hover effects and transitions
- Improve image container styling and spacing
- Better handling of missing images
